# Support Buddy

AI-powered internal support tool that helps Technical Support Engineers handle customer inquiries faster and more accurately.

## Project Context

- **Owner:** Ella (Technical Support Engineer)
- **Goal:** Reduce TSE onboarding from 2 weeks to days; enable 80%+ of customer inquiries to be answered through this tool
- **Domain:** Customer support for a SaaS product (developed with a virtual company scenario for testing)

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic SDK) with tool use
- **Knowledge Store:** ChromaDB (vector embeddings) + structured Markdown/JSON docs
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (MVP) → React (later)
- **Integrations:** Linear API, GitHub API, Email (IMAP)
- **Testing:** pytest, pytest-asyncio

## Development Workflow

1. **Superpowers workflow:** Brainstorming → Git Worktree → Plan → Subagent Dev (TDD) → Code Review → Branch Finish
2. **agentic-dev-pipeline:** Used for verification (lint → test → security → triangular review)
3. **TDD enforced:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for all features

## Key Rules

- Never commit secrets (.env, API keys, credentials) - they are in .gitignore
- All new features require tests FIRST (TDD)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Domain knowledge files go in `data/knowledge/` as Markdown or JSON
- Log analysis must handle arbitrary log formats gracefully
- AI responses must always cite their source from the knowledge base

## Git & PR Rules

- PR bodies and titles must always be written in English
- Always create PRs with `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` — never push a branch without opening a PR
- PR body must include: Summary (what changed and why), Test plan (checklist)
